            Git repository to track. A bare device tracks the upstream core; a
            workplace points this at its own overlay flake (which consumes the
            DAWO core as an input) so the chosen overlay rides along.

            The default is the address the core moved to. A device that was
            imaged before the move and never had this set keeps polling the old
            one until it takes an update that carries this change, which it
            cannot take from a repository that no longer moves: such a device
            has to be pointed at the new URL by hand once.

            Path on the device to a read-only SSH deploy key for repoUrl. Empty
            (the default) means no credential, which is right for a public
            repository.

            A private overlay needs this. A netrc gives *nix* a credential,
            which is what nix needs to fetch a private flake input, but comin
            does not fetch through nix: it clones the repository itself, with
            its own git client, reading this. Without it such a deployment
            authenticates for the rebuild and not for the pull that triggers it,
            and comin logs the failed pull at error level and goes back to
            sleep. The only symptom is a device that quietly stops moving.

            A deploy key rather than an account token: a token can read every
            repository its account can read, and it would sit on every device in
            the fleet. A deploy key reads one repository and cannot write to it.

            This is a runtime path, deliberately a string rather than a path:
            a Nix path literal would copy the private key into /nix/store, where
            it is world readable. There is an assertion for that.

            Path to a known_hosts file carrying the host key of repoUrl. Empty
            means comin falls back to /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.

            Pin it rather than trusting on first use: these devices roam across
            networks nobody here runs, and trust on first use trusts whatever
            answers first. A store path is fine here - host keys are public.
