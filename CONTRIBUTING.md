# Contributing to DAWO NixOS

Thank you for your interest in contributing! To maintain a high standard of quality and clarity, please follow our contribution guidelines.

## 🌍 Language Policy
- **Primary Language**: English. All documentation, pull request descriptions, code comments, and technical discussions must be conducted in English. This is to facilitate easy collaboration across borders.
- **Exception**: Dutch is permitted strictly within the **issue tracker** (for internal coordination or specific local context). Do not use Dutch in comments, pull requests or commit messages. Documentation can be translated to both languages when the need arises.

## 🤖 AI Policy
- **Disclosure**: When using AI, disclose this. Please refer to the relevant model(s) and agent(s) uses for creating code, issues and PRs.
- **Responsible use**: Please only use AI when it addresses a specific need. Otherwise, plain human discussion and coding is preferred.
- **Human compatibility**: when using AI for generating code, it is still the responsibility of the developer to provide high quality code. This code must be understandable on a human level so troubleshooting can be done by mere mortals.

## 🛠 Workflow
To ensure every change is tracked and reviewed effectively, please follow this pipeline:

1.  **Issue first**: Every new feature, bug fix, or enhancement must be logged as an **issue** before any code is written. High-level requirements should be discussed here to gain consensus.
2.  **Pull requests (PRs)**: Once the issue is defined and discussed, create your pull request. Add the `WIP:` prefix when you're still working on the PR. Assign a reviewer as soon as your PR is ready.
3.  **Linkage**: Every PR *must* reference its corresponding issue number in the title or description (e.g., `Ref: #123`). 
4.  **Code-Only Discussions**: Please keep pull request discussions strictly focused on the code changes themselves. Structural debates, feature requests, or off-topic discussions should be moved back to the original issue or a new issue.
5.  **Labelling**: Please attach all relevant labels to issues and pull requests.

## 🤓 Development setup

To try out your changes, deploy them to a test machine or [QEMU VM](./docs/qemu-vm.md)

## 📝 Commit Standards
We follow the **Conventional Commits** specification. This allows us to automatically generate changelogs and keep our history clean.

Your commit messages should follow this format:
`<type>(optional scope): <description>`

*Example:* `feat(networking): add BGP support with community tags`
*Common types:* 
- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `docs`: Documentation only changes.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `chore`: Updating dependencies or build scripts.

## 🚀 Let's Build!
